    "# Project Overview\n",
    "The Advanced Computing Center for Research and Education (ACCRE) operates Vanderbilt University's high-performance computing cluster. Jobs submitted to ACCRE are managed by the [slurm scheduler](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html), which tracks compute and memory resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACCRE staff have hypothesized that the scheduler sometimes becomes unresponsive because it is processing large bursts of job completions. This especially affects automated job submitters, such as members of the Open Science Grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to evaluate whether the data supports the hypothesis of bursts of job completions contributing to scheduler unresponsiveness."
